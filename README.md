##  What is this? :question:

This is a simple Discord Bot that gives you access to basic moderation commands. I made this project to learn more about discord bots and the discord.py library. I decided to make it open source to show what I was able to learn and to allow other people to iterate on it if they wish to do so.

## Dependencies :page_with_curl:
- [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)
